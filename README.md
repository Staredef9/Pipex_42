# Pipex_42
My project for 42_school used to recreate the behaviour of the PIPE utility in C.
//////////
This project was incredibily useful to understand a lot about processes and system calls to handle them in UNIX like systems.
I also took the chance to further explore the topic on the book "Operating system concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne.
Big thanks also to my colleagues of the school and Code Vault youtube channel, that has a thorough explanation of processes in UNIX LINUX systems.
